                and human systems grow together.

                <p className="dr-body">
                FarmOrchestra exists at the intersection of hydroponics, computer science,
                and systems thinking. It treats farming as an intelligent system,
                technology as a collaborator, and learning as an open process.
                </p>
                <p className="dr-body">
                The project embraces openness, experimentation, and observation over
                optimization for its own sake. Progress comes from understanding
                relationships—between plants and sensors, code and environment,
                people and food.

                        IoT and automation are tools for precision and balance, not
                        control. When technology and biology work together, farming
                        becomes a symphony rather than a struggle.
